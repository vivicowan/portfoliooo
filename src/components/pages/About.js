        <p>Hey there!</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am a junior developer from San Diego. Later this summer, I will be a
          transfer student at the University of Texas in Arlington earning my
          degree in Software Engineering. I enjoy learning new things and take
          every challenge head-on. I have an eye for detail and a vivid
          imagination.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Although I am new to the world of technology, I am eager to jump right
          in and see the fascinating opportunities tech has to offer.
